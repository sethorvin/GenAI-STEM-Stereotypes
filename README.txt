This repository includes the HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript necessary for deploying a static website (through GitHub pages) 
for a project entitled "STEM Stereotypes Through the Lens of Generative Artificial Intelligence". The website implementation 
is based on a template named "Stellar" that was uploaded to html5up.net by @ajlkn. The template is free for personal and
commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license).


This project was completed by Seth Orvin within the Schedler Honors College at the University of Central Arkansas 
for presentation through the Justice and Equity Honors Network. The project investigates the influence of societal 
biases of race and gender on the output of three text-to-image AI tools: ImageFX from Google, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0
(base version, without refinement), and Adobe Firefly.
