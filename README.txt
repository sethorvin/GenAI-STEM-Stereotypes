This repository includes the HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript necessary for deploying a static website (through GitHub pages) 
for a project entitled "STEM Stereotypes Through the Lens of Generative Artificial Intelligence". The website implementation 
is based on a template named "Stellar" that was uploaded to html5up.net by @ajlkn. The template is free for personal and
commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license).


This project was completed by Seth Orvin within the Schedler Honors College at the University of Central Arkansas 
for presentation through the Justice and Equity Honors Network.
